# React Native: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`. This error arises when a component attempts to access a property of an object that is currently undefined or null, often due to asynchronous operations where the data isn't immediately available.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that triggers this error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that incorporates safe navigation and conditional rendering to prevent this error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on your preferred React Native environment.
4. Observe the error in the `bug.js` example.
5. Compare this to the working solution in `bugSolution.js`.
